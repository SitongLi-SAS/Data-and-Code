Without the paper’s exact series codes, missing-data sequence, and IN4.0 definition, the replication reasonably prioritizes specification alignment and transparent proxies. The positive baseline effect (IRA→GTI) persists; differences in the interaction/mediation significance under NA or non-significance primarily signal sensitivity to sample construction, not a refutation. Author-level metadata would be required to fully align results.
