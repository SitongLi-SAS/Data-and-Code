A. Reasonableness of the replication data and construction
The replication is methodologically well-aligned with the original specification. It uses a two-way fixed-effects (within) estimator, lags IRA by one period, and includes the same control set (FDI, PGDP, HC, IS, UR) with cluster-robust standard errors. This configuration is technically coherent and auditable; it also explains why the intercept prints as “Constant = NA,” since the within transformation absorbs the grand mean. Where the paper does not disclose executable, variable-level metadata, the replication adopts transparent, literature-plausible proxies rather than inventing new constructs. Most notably, Industry 4.0 (IN4.0) is operationalized with a 2011 cutoff time dummy that interacts with lagged IRA—faithful to the paper’s interaction idea even if not identical to an undisclosed, author-specific threshold. The data pipeline is internally consistent: descriptive statistics precede estimation, the working panel is clearly defined, and winsorization/formatting choices are documented (e.g., small but significant coefficients may render as 0.000 when rounded to three decimals). On identification, the replication follows the paper’s logic—PSM, Heckman two-step, and Lewbel (2012) IV—so the causal pathway is addressed with the same families of estimators even when some diagnostics cannot be reproduced verbatim without the original dataset and exact series codes. In sum, given the absence of fully specified indicators, retrieval timestamps, and country-level definition rules, the replication prioritizes specification alignment and transparent approximations. This is a reasonable and defensible strategy that preserves the baseline economic content (IRA → GTI) while clearly flagging where perfect comparability depends on author-level metadata.

B. Why NA/“truncation” appears, and how it relates to definition alignment
Several NA or “truncation” patterns arise from definitional and data-access constraints rather than estimation failure. First, Constant = NA is mechanical under two-way FE with a within estimator: the intercept is not separately identified after demeaning. Second, coefficients shown as “0.000*”** reflect display rounding for very small yet statistically significant estimates; the magnitude is non-zero, but three-decimal formatting masks it. Third, NA entries in some PSM/Heckman/IV diagnostic rows are deliberate placeholders when a statistic is inapplicable to a given model or when an extraction routine standardizes table shapes across columns; these are presentation artifacts, not signs that the regressions failed. The most substantive NA/truncation issue concerns the mediation chain (GRD/GRDP): these measures require multiple base series to be jointly available (e.g., R&D totals, patent totals, and the Y02P share). Without the paper’s exact series codes and its missing-data sequence/balancing rules, any country–year lacking one component propagates an NA that “breaks” the chain, yielding empty cells for parts of the mediation equations. A related alignment issue affects the IN4.0 interaction: the paper’s thresholding and panel-balancing protocol are not specified at a reproducible level, so the replication’s reasonable 2011 cutoff can produce a different composition of usable observations (e.g., 884 vs. 766/754/752 in the paper’s columns). Because interaction terms are highly sensitive to sample composition and balancing, significance can shift even when the underlying mechanism is similar. Finally, missing retrieval timestamps/platform versions and WDI/other series identifiers prevent exact re-pulls of the authors’ dataset; NA/truncation should therefore be interpreted as markers of definitional misalignment with the C2 dataset rather than substantive contradictions. The practical remedy is to obtain author-level metadata (series codes, time-stamped pulls, missingness order, balancing protocol, exact IN4.0 definition) and then re-estimate under locked definitions; until then, NA patterns primarily reflect data-side constraints, not flaws in the replication’s econometric construction.
